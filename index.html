          <b>The workplace should fulfill lives, not drain them.</b>
        </p>

        <p>
           The success of your business depends on your ability to align,
           motivate, and empower the people you hire. Imagine a world where
           the people around you find fulfillment in their work. A world
           where they have the tools necessary to do <b>their best work on the
           things that matter.</b> That's the world we want to live in.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our mission is to help you understand the people you work with and
          the customers you serve. We built Scoreboard to take decades of research
          on alignment, engagement, and motivation and apply it to the modern
          workplace. All growing businesses run into the same fundamental problems.
          <b>You don't have to figure this out alone.</b> We're hear to help.
        </p>

        <p>
          Coming Soon.
